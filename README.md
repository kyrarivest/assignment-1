Kyra Rivest

I'm majoring in computer science and applied math. I will work in cloud engineering after graduation. I'm considering doing a master's degree in data science, but at this point I want to work for a little before that. I took this course because I'm interested in climate science and working with environmental data. Outside fo school, I like to work out, digitally paint, and take pictures.
